# CloseLidToggle-C-Sharp

CloseLidToggle changes what closing the lid of your laptop does, with convenient access through taskbar. No need to fiddle around with settings in Windows, which takes like 10 seconds longer (yes, not a lot of time but I still found it frustrating enough).

## Usage

Just run it. You can place it in your startup if you like it.
